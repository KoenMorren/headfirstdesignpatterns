## The Observer pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The Observer pattern addresses the following problems:
* A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled.
* It should be ensured that when one object changes state, an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.
* It should be possible that one object can notify an open-ended number of other objects.
